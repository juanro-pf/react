Hi!

Welcome to my React JS projects repo.

To run projects from 3 to 8 (except for 6) you need to have node JS installed on your computer, if you don't have it go ahead and download it from here:
https://nodejs.org/en/

If you have already node JS installed, follow the next steps to run a project:

1.- Clone the repo
2.- Open your terminal on the project folder you want to run, for example on 07-heroes-app
3.- Run the command "npm install"
4.- Run the command "npm start"
5.- Open your browser (I recommend Google Chrome) and go to http://localhost:3000/

For projects 9 and 10 (Which are the same project, just 9 is the frontend and 10 the backend) you can see it here https://mern-calendar-jro.herokuapp.com/
